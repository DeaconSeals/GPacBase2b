    "Recall from the lecture and videos by Dr. Koza that GP tends to produce individual genotypes of increasing size without a mechanism to curb this. You will implement a parsimony penalty to encourage your GP to produce more compact trees (in addition to the depth limits you already have). With this mechanism of parsimony pressure, you will penalize the fitness of a solution based on their size. $fitness(i)=rawFitness(i)-C_p*size(i)$ where $C_p$ is a penalty coefficient from your config file and $size(i)$ is a function that returns the size of individual $i$. The two most obvious metrics of tree size are tree depth and node count, but you are encouraged with experiments to use the size metric that performs best.\n",

    "**Note**: The implementation of a parsimony penalty is nearly identical to the penalty-based constraint satisfaction method you implemented in Assignment 1c. Like Assignment 1c, *it is not meaningful to compare penalized fitness with unpenalized fitness* and we require that you use penalized fitness for evolution and raw fitness for analysis.\n",

    "Should you apply GP after this class, you should know that the GP algorithm taught in this class (as described in the course textbook) differs somewhat from the algorithm canonically used in GP. Notably, the textbook has certain important omissions regarding the Ramped Half-and-half algorithm and the GP evolutionary cycle. Canonically, the Ramped Half-and-half algorithm uses a `grow` method which ensures at least 1 branch reaches the depth limit. This can be difficult to implement, and has little impact on this assignment, so we don't require the implementation of the canonical version of the algorithm.\n",

    "More importantly, however, is that the canonical GP evolutionary cycle is generational in nature. In the canonical Generational GP algorithm, $\\mu$ children are created each generation via recombination, mutation, or reproduction and the children directly replace the parents without survival selection. The algorithm you implement for this assignment series is much more similar to a Genetic Algorithm in nature and you should be aware of this distinction if you continue to work with GP.
